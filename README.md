### How to convert .ipynb to html

Ensuring that `jupyter` has been pip installed on your computer. Then, you will be able to convert your ipynb file to one of many options: asciidoc, custom, html, latex, markdown, notebook, pdf, python, rst, script, slides

For this project, we'll be converting ipynb's to html files, so we run something like this in the terminal:
> jupyter nbconvert --to html filename.ipynb
